            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Giant Galaxy Orbiting Our Own Just Appeared Out of Nowhere</h1><p>Researchers scanning the skies just got a big surprise. They spotted a humongous galaxy orbiting our own, where none had been seen before. It appeared, seemingly, out of nowhere. So, just how did the newly-discovered Crater 2 manage to pull off this feat, like a deer leaping from the interstellar bushes to stare us down through our collective headlights?</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3b53f341e9bfa1b291542ff36d386f62/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fi.kinja-img.com%2Fgawker-media%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fs--KJc-Uo0o--%2Fc_scale%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_80%2Cw_800%2Fssbcmy6vcoq8ggiiinid.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Light Phone: Designed for Disconnecting</h1><p>Phone addiction is real-as evidenced by a quick glance down the street, in the subway, even at the dinner table-and is one of the reasons why Apple developed a watch: so we would look at our screens less and be present more.
